# Recurrent Neural Network

**How to build a Recurrent Neural Network with Python**

1. First of all, we should know the Reason, why we want to use a RNN
   - NLP, by the natural language processing, we need to know the relationship between words and sentences
   - Machine translation
   - 


2. Layers of the Neural Networks
   - input and output
   - fully connect layer
   - hidden layer

3. Parameters of a Network
   -
